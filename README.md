This repository will host all the source code, CAD files, and diagrams I will be using to build my second custom keyboard (you can find my [first one here](https://github.com/nafajardo/PhantomTKL)).

## Plan
Similar to my first keyboard, I want to first do some research on what layout I am looking for, draw it up on my computer, and then do some experimentation. Unlike my first build, I would like to make this keyboard ortholinear (non staggered), and start exploring the realm of layered functionality instead of limiting my layout to predefined standards like qwerty. Interesting layouts exist like [dvorak](https://www.dvorak-keyboard.com/) that seem cool to learn, and could possibly be better.

Ideally, I would like to utilize my 3D printer somehow in this build to dust off my PLA reels. Unlike my first keyboard build, I would want to explore some woodworking in this keyboard, and possibly utilize some sort of joint system like [any of these](http://metosexpo.free.fr/extra/wood_ebooks/others/The%20Joint%20Book.pdf).

The plan to implement the keyboard will probably go in this order:
- [ ] Design Keyboard Layout
- [ ] Decide on switches
- [ ] Design PCB, if needed
- [ ] Design Case in CAD
- [ ] Fabricate Keyboard

## Tools Required
Software:
* [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/)
* [Plate Creator](http://builder.swillkb.com/)
* [Solidworks](https://www.solidworks.com/)

Hardware:
* [Cherry MX Clear Switch](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX_Clear)

## Design Keyboard Layout
After some internal discourse, I am currently looking at folowing a keyboard layout like this:

![Keyboard Layout Picture]{/TinyKeeb/KeyboardLayout}

One presses shift on any of the letters to get the Capitol version of it, and shift on any other key to get the alternate ket on the bottom left of a given keykap. However, the bottom right of any given key can only be accessed when pressing the Fn button next to the spacebar, which is located on the left of the Fn key since I usually use my right thumb to press it.
## Decide on switches
## Design PCB, if needed
## Design Case in CAD
## Fabricate Keyboard
